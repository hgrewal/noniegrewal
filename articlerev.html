                      As a woman in computing I have a unique opinion on women in computing, or more over the lack of women 
                      in computing. First of all, I will admit that it makes me sad to see so few women in a career that I 
                      feel has so much potential. I believe that women are just as likely to enjoy and succeed in computing 
                      as men are. That being said, where my opinion does differ from many other popular beliefs is the women
                      suffer in Computer Science due to little support and outright oppression. 

                      <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                      I understand that there is a great disparity in the number of women in the technical field, and men. 
                      But I do not believe that this creates a disadvantage for the women that are already in Computer 
                      Science. Take for examples an experience that I had the second year of my undergraduate studies. 
                      
                      <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                      While working on a group project for an organization I encountered a peculiar situation. Out of the 
                      fifteen or so people in the room, I was the only woman. The group leader began to talk about what we 
                      needed to do in order to prepare to work on the project - this included downloading appropriate software 
                      and prepping our working environments. Once he explained what was to be done, he immediately walked over
                      to me and asked if I needed help. He then proceeded to take my laptop and help me install the software. 
                      
                      <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                      I was obviously stunned and did not know what to do. I did not need help. I never asked for help. It
                      had been established that no one else in the room had worked with the tools we were expected to download 
                      either - we were all in the same boat. Why did the he assume that <i>I</i> needed help? 

                      <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                      
                      From my experience I have learnt that not only are women not expected to pursue a Computer Science career, 
                      as illustrated by Randall Stross in his article, but they are assumed to not belong either. And yes 
                      I can see how this story is coming to a conclusion that will directly contrast my initial claim - that women 
                      are not oppressed in Computer Science - but to me it is the exact opposite. 
                      
                      <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                      I remember I immediately became incredibly offended. A part of me wanted to walk out and never come back to 
                      what I thought of then as a misogynistic environment. But once I had cooled down, I realized that me quitting 
                      would be directly encouraging the belief that women do not belong or are oppressed in Computer Science. This 
                      is what prompted me to continue with the project, and not only that but to work ten times harder than I had 
                      planned on. I wanted to prove my legitimacy, not to show the rest of the members of the project, but to prove 
                      to myself that I am just as capable. 

                      <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                      In his article Stross defines the many attributes that drive women out of Computer Science. He stresses the fact 
                      that not only is the number of women lacking in Computer Science, but they are decreasing over the years. In the 
                      last twenty-five years the number of women in computer science has dropped from 40% to less than 10%. A tribulation
                      that is unique to Computer Science when comparing to other Science and Engineering majors, in which the number of 
                      women has and is increasing. 

                      <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                      Ross reveals some of the factors that may be attributed to the decrease of women. He reports that a reason why more
                      women were interested in Computer Science in the past was because the present-day stereotypes of programming did not
                      exist at the time. This is the "nerd" or "geek" profile given to programmers. More over the subculture of action video
                      games was not present at the time, another implication that computers are for men. Ross believes that it is this 
                      stigma that repels women from joining Computer Science. 

                      <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                      
                      Although I understand Ross's dissertation, and to a large extent agree with it; I feel that the greater issue is that
                      women are defined to be unbelonging in Computer Science. And furthermore, this is a perception that is often times shared 
                      by women themselves. Ross further suggests this can be solved by implementing a sub-culture that relates women's 
                      interests with coding directly. In addition to his suggestion, I believe that we should be focusing on breaking the 
                      theoretical barriers that women feel prohibit them from succeeding in Computer Science, and instead building the bridges
                      that remove the concept of gender from software engineering altogether. 

                      <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                      
                      That is that men and women should focus on treating one another equally with in the major. Women should not be seen as the
                      lesser, or the minority. Instead there should be direct measures taken that disregard the gender disparity altogether. 
                      Stop talking about how it feels to be a woman in technology, and instead be a professional technologist. 

                      <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                      
                      Going back to my experience, it was not until I got over my initial feelings of anger and anguish, that I realized the
                      group leader was honestly trying to be nice. I do not think he had a negative motive, but instead was ignorant to the 
                      fact that I did not need additional help because I am a woman. It was then that I was able to "ignore" his actions, my 
                      so-called oppression, and work around it (or with it depending on how you see it) and just get my part of the project 
                      done in an efficient and professional manner. 

                      <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                      
                      Therefore, I do agree with Ross, that another important (more important in my opinion) step needed to be taken is the 
                      education of Computer Science and its potential, which does not solely lie in gaming, is necessary at an early age. 
                      This way we can break the negative perceptions young men and women may have about programming allowing them a fair
                      opportunity to join Computer Science.
